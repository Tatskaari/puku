    * Parse the whole third party tree to find go_module rules (#56)

Version 0.2.0
------------
    * Fixed some issues around resolving install lists on `go_repo` and `go_module` (#33)
    * Implemented default visibility. This will be parsed out of `package()` statements
      in BUILD files automatically, but rules can be configured to assume a certain
      visibility. This can be useful for rules like `go_repo` that default to PUBLIC.
